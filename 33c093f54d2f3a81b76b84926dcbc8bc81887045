      "message": "Thank you for the feedback.\n\nI understand the concern about adding libraries prematurely. Based on the current needs, I plan to use most of these libraries right away. The exception is react-query, which I can hold off on until it’s confirmed necessary. I’m happy to focus on the UI/UX first and make final decisions afterward.\n\nPlease let me know if there’s anything else I should consider.",
